<h1>Events</h1>
<h2>Games Days</h2>
The Computing Student Association hosts two different types of games days – a card and board games day, as well as an online computer games day.
<h3>Board Game Days</h3>
<p>
Our monthly board game days are run in partnership with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UFVPPT/">Pen and Paper Tabletop Club</a>, and see a host of different games being placed every month. Everything from classics like <a href="https://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup>Coup</a> to new and hard to find games like Sub Terra and Snake Oil. Come join the CSA and the Pen and Paper Tabletop Club once a month for some fun!
</p>

<p>
Our next scheduled Games Day is November 20th from 10-5pm, in the North section of Evered Hall.
</p>
<h3>Online Game Days</h3>
<p>
Our online computer games days are a bit less formal, and can be organized on the fly. Utilizing our Discord channel to offer VoIP and text chat to both members of the association and the public, everyone is welcome to join in for our online games days. Common games that appear in our online games days are Rocket League, Insurgency, Arma III, PayDay 2, any any other games people bring up.
</p>

<p>
Members of the CSA gather every Friday night in our Discord, however there’s always people lurking should you be looking for someone to game with any other night of the week.
